Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify which customers are likely to leave (churn) and understand the factors influencing their decision. The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and behavioral attributes.

The project pipeline includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns

Data cleaning, encoding, handling missing values, and feature scaling

Feature engineering and outlier treatment to improve model performance

Implementation of classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Model evaluation using metrics like ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and classification report

SHAP values and gain charts for model interpretability and business insights

The final model helps in understanding key drivers of churn and supports strategic customer retention efforts.
